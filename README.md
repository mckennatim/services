### 04-social-auth-pre-deploy
ugh
Got rid of passport.use(new ApikeyStrategy)

### 03-geniot-try_catch-middleware
`social-auth` creates a record for a user in devuserapp for the spa that used it. That spa also gets back a token created using the api's secret. 

Since all the heavy lifting and passport stuff has been shuttled of to `social-auth` `modules/regtokau/strategy/bearerToken` just has to intercept a request, grab its token and tell the endware what's up.

#### Middleware 
works like so. Here is what middleware looks like 

    var bearerToken = function(req,res, next){
        ...check token (req.tokenAuth = what's up)
        next()
    }

    router.get('/appsa', bearerToken, function(req,res){
        ... now you can do whatever to the request if req.tokenAuth.auth
        res.jsonp(req.tokenAuth)
    })

It is just like this kind of callback thingy

    router.get('/appsa', function(req,res){
        bearerToken(req,res, function(){
            cons.log(req.tokenAuth)
            res.jsonp(req.tokenAuth)
        })
    })

but cooler

#### try catch
jwt.decode croak on errors like bad or expired tokens so you have to catch them

    try { 
        var tokdata = jwt.decode(toka[1], cfg.secret)
        cons.log(tokdata)
    } catch(e){
        cons.log(e.message)
        req.tokenAuth = {auth: false, message: e.message}
        next()
        return
    } 

## todo
Connnect social-auth to geniot.
